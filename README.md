# Intro to React with TanStack Router

This repository is based on the [Frontend Masters course "Complete Intro to React"](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v9/) with which I enhanced my skills using React.

## Start app

Open the directory in your terminal and run:

```shell
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

It will start the api server and the application for you.

See the log in the terminal giving you a hint for the port on localhost:

```shell
VITE v5.4.2  ready in 117 ms
[1] 
[1]   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
[1]   ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

## Possible Improvements

- Deploy Application with serverless AWS
  - For the DB in the API you might want to use Neon
